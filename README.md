# Quickcart-Data-Integrity-Crisis
### Project Summary

QuickCart, a fast-growing e-commerce startup, experienced a P0 incident when Marketing’s “Total Sales” dashboard did not match the official bank settlement statement.

This project establishes a single, finance-grade, bank-reconcilable Source of Truth within 5 days by cleaning raw transaction logs, reconciling production database inconsistencies, and validating internal revenue against bank settlements.

The objective is not dashboarding — it is to prove the real revenue in a defensible, auditable, and explainable way.
